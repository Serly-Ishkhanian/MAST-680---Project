# MAST-680-Project
In the file "Project_MAST680", the code on how to use randomized methods can be found. Specifically, two experiments are conducted using the randomized methods and the singular value decomposition (SVD). 

Experiment 1: Image compression with a small dataset 
Experiment 2: Background-Foreground Separation of the Ski Drop video (used in Assignment 1) to compare the results of the speed and performance of the randomized DMD and the DMD with the SVD used.
